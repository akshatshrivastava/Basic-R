This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 
Here I have done a Quick Data Exploration of IRIS Dataset in R. Iris is a popular dataset, and fairly easy to operate upon and hence is best choice for a beginner project

1. First I will attach all the necessary packages into the current R Script.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(ellipse)
```
2. After this, I will call IRIS dataset into current library using the function *data( )*, and *head()* is used to see first few rows of dataset

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

Lets find out dimensions of iris dataset, and each species associated with the dataset.

```{r}
dim(iris)
table(iris$Species)
```

3. IRIS Dataset is clean, that is it has no missing values, outlier or NA values. Tougher datasets will be covered in next projects.

We'll first plot a scatterplot matrix

```{r}
plot(iris)
```

*featurePlot()* is a part of caret package.

```{r}
x <- iris[,1:4]
y <- iris[,5]
featurePlot(x=x, y=y ,plot="ellipse")
```

Scatterplot matrix, draws plots for all the variables in the dataset. But you can't get any clear idea, so I will do some more DATA VISUALISATION.

4. BOXPLOTS - They can be plotted using Boxplot command. A for loop is used to repeat the *boxplot ()* command over all the SPECIES, and *par( )* is used to create boxplots for multiple graphs in a single window.

```{r}

par(mfrow=c(1,4))
  for(i in 1:4) {
  boxplot(x[,i], main=names(iris)[i])
  }
```
5. DENSITY PLOTS - They can be plotted using *density* command. A for loop is used to repeat the *density* command over all the SPECIES, and *par()* is used to create boxplots for multiple graphs in a single window.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,4))
for(i in 1:4) {
plot(density(iris[,i]), main=names(iris)[i])
}
```
6. HISTOGRAM - They can be plotted using *hist* command. A for loop is used to repeat the *hist* command over all the SPECIES, and *par()* is used to create boxplots for multiple graphs in a single window.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,4))
for(i in 1:4) {
hist(iris[,i], main=names(iris)[i])
}
```
7. GGPLOT - is a standard library for data visualisation. LEts look at how data varies between Petal Length and Sepal Length

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('Iris Species by Petal Length and Sepal Length')
```
8. Again use GGPLOT, a standard library for data visualisation. Lets look at how data varies between Petal Width and Sepal Width

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width, colour = Species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('Iris Species by Petal Length and Sepal Width')
```
9. LINEAR REG - lets perform linear regression.

```{r}
#linear reg
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
```{r}
#linear reg
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Petal.Width,  color=Species)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

AND THAT WOULD BE IT!! This is just a beginner project, so only basic is covered, which is already presented on my

For more project stay tuned....
