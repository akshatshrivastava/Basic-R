Hi!!! I have done the loop for the mean part, and hope you will do the variance part by yourself



```{r Code for normal distribution}
#finding normal and sorting 
r1<-sort(rnorm(50, sd=3, mean=2))
print(r1)
```
```{r}
#extracting 10 number from the list
r1[10]
```



Here is the loop for finding mean

```{r Loop for mean}
means <- c()
for(i in 1:1000){
  n <- sort(rnorm(50, sd=3, mean=2))
  y<-n[10]
  means[i] <- mean(y)
  }
mean(means)
```
I am pretty sure, it is correct. However check it one time,
just to be sure.
